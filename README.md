# Why, how, who and what

### Why _Gonna Make It_?

A new web paradigm is being built, its name is web 3.0. Because in web 3.0 ownership and upside are shared among platform participants, this new paradigm can create a more inclusive economy.

Even though web 3.0 offers a whole new design space for consumer layer applications, the change must start from current user demand and habits. As Clayton Christensen says in _The Innovator's Dilemma_:

> "A technology has the potential to be _disruptive_ if the trajectory of improvement is steep enough to intersect the demand of the mainstream market."&#x20;

_Gonna Make It'_s mission is to enable the transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0 at scale.

### How _Gonna Make It_?

In the information overload era, attracting people's attention has become harder than ever. With +3.2B people in the world playing video games more than 7 hours per week, gaming is one of the biggest attention keepers on earth.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In 2020 people consumed +100B watch time hours in YouTube alone. In this context, +80,000 YouTube gaming creators hit 100K subscribers​, +1,000 YouTube gaming creators hit 5 million subscribers​ and +350 YouTube gaming creators hit 10 million subscribers​.

Live-streamed gaming content was also on the rise​ with +27 billion hours of esports across Twitch, YouTube Gaming, and Facebook Gaming.

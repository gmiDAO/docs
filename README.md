# What, why and how

_Gonna Make It_ is a platform that allows to easily bet, do marketing and earn assets on existing games through [gonnamakeit.app](https://gonnamakeit.app). Initially, it will provide the following tools:

**Challenge markets (CMs):** anyone can create, invest and do challenges for existing games.

Liquidity providers can lock digital assets in a challenge to earn the challengees’ entry fees. Alternatively, marketers can reward participants with product/brand-related crypto assets.

They are betting that no player will win the challenge — prove them wrong!

&#x20;

**Multiplayer engine (ME):** anyone can bid anything s/he/they want to challenge anyone to play a game/tournament. Solana smart contracts (programs) based on the results will distribute the digital assets accordingly among participants. This can be used for Marketing and/or Betting purposes.

&#x20;

**Play2mint (P2M):** a new way to mint that favours the average Joe. Anyone can use this tool to drop their NFTs avoiding frontrunning and server overload. Further, GMI will be no-rug only, so people can mint comfortably. To mint NFTs, collectors will have to play a game and achieve the minimum required.

### Why

In the information overload era, attracting people's attention has become harder than ever. With +3B gamers in the world, gaming is one of the biggest attention keepers on earth. Another big brain attractor is money. In this context, digital assets and social media allow for a new distribution paradigm where the long-tail is financially incentivized to promote their favorite projects.

We thought that leveraging these forces to make a decentralized distribution machine based on gaming and digital assets would be a great idea – several existing markets involved here (game shows, interactive marketing, betting, matchmaking, …) + if done well, community-owned projects (sacrificing centralization) have proven to be a thing (incentives of masses aligned = social movement = difficult to replicate business). Introduce the GMI platform.

### How&#x20;

_Gonna Make It_ is a community-owned brand with the mission to enable new experiences on existing games through [gonnamakeit.app](https://gonnamakeit.app).

The idea is to build a media and entertainment business. GMI.app will provide the tooling to bet and create challenges on existing games and the community-owned brand _Gonna Make It_ will provide distribution of these creations for a premium through GMI social media distribution channels (one per language).

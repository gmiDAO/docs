# Why, how and what

### Why

In the information overload era, attracting people's attention has become harder than ever.&#x20;

With +3.2B people in the world playing video games more than 7 hours per week, gaming is one of the biggest attention keepers on earth.&#x20;

In 2020 people consumed +100B watch time hours in YouTube alone. In this context, +80,000 YouTube gaming creators hit 100K subscribers​, +1,000 YouTube gaming creators hit 5 million subscribers​ and +350 YouTube gaming creators hit 10 million subscribers​.

Live-streamed gaming content was also on the rise​ with +27 billion hours of esports across Twitch, YouTube Gaming, and Facebook Gaming.

Another big brain attractor is money and now money is becoming digital.&#x20;

Gonna Make It’s objective is to allow gamers, marketers and creators to do more with their favourite games, brands and assets.

### How&#x20;

_Gonna Make It DAO_ is a community-owned brand with the mission to enable new experiences on existing games through [gonnamakeit.io](https://gonnamakeit.io).

Nowadays the DAO is formed by [GMI's operating team](https://gonnamakeit.io/about) but [The Handy Game](https://gonnamakeit.gitbook.io/gonna-make-it/handy-game/overview) will change this because all Hand NFT holders will get $GMI and $GGMI pre-IDO tokens thus joining gmiDAO. &#x20;

$GMI and $GGMI tokens can also be earned by using the platform and adding value to the community.

### What

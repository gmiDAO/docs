### Why

In the information overload era, attracting people's attention has become harder than ever. With +3B gamers in the world, gaming is one of the biggest attention keepers on earth. Another big brain attractor is money. In this context, digital assets and social media allow for a new distribution paradigm where the long-tail is financially incentivized to promote their favourite projects.

We thought that leveraging these forces to make a decentralized distribution machine based on the games and digital assets that people use would be a good media and entertainment tool.

# Why, how and what

### Why _Gonna Make It_?

A new web paradigm is being built, its name is web 3.0. In this new paradigm, platforms are decentralized and ownership is shared among platform participants.

Even though web 3.0 offers a whole new design space for consumer layer applications, the change must start from current user habits. As Clayton Christensen says in _The Innovator's Dilemma_:

> "A technology has the potential to be _disruptive_ if the trajectory of improvement is steep enough to intersect the demand of the mainstream market."&#x20;

_Gonna Make It'_s mission is to enable the transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0 at scale.

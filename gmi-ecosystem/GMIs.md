# ðŸ’² GMIs

$GMIs are [gonnamakeit.io](https://gonnamakeit.io)'s utility and governance tokens. They can be earned by **playing, referring and creating** GMI experiences.

$GMIs have the following utilities in the platform:

* Fee discounts
* Payment method for Gonna Make It's pay2play challenges, matches and tournaments
* Unlimited challenges in Gonna Make It's challenge markets
* Unlimited match rooms in Gonna Make It's Multiplayer Engine
* Unlimited tournaments in Gonna Make It's Multiplayer Engine
* Have under collateralization allowance in PvP betting
* Discount in featured challenges, matches or tournaments

$GMIs are gmiDAO's governance tokens.

$GMI holders will be able to claim rewards if they stake their tokens in Gonna Make It's governance staking program.

Our goal with $GMI is to align the incentives between the players, distributors and developers of GMI experiences by:

* Rewarding players for playing and distributing GMI experiences while simultaneously incentivizing them to hold on to their tokens so they can claim additional rewards.
* Decentralizing the ownership and governance of _Gonna Make It_ in matters like:
  * Treasury management.
  * New game integrations.
  * GMI influencer program.
  * GMI staking rewards.
  * New official tournaments (e.g. The Handy Game).
  * New Multiplayer Engine game modes (customized Smart Contracts allow for game modes).
  * NFT pricing mechanisms to match the fair value of bets.
  * New marketing campaign deals.
  * ...

We want _Gonna Make It_ to become a truly community-owned and operated platform and brand. This opens up limitless possibilities but must be approached carefully - the shift to a truly decentralized organization will occur gradually over time as $GMI token ownership decentralizes.

The Community Treasury will begin to receive revenues generated by _Gonna Make It_ as well as a portion of staking rewards. This treasury will be governed by $GMI stakers eventually, once the network has become sufficiently decentralized.

The Treasury receives inflows from:

* 5% of all Hand NFT secondary market trades.
* X% of all entry fees of non Free2Play Challenges, Matches, and Tournaments.
* Usage fees on centralized services provided by gmiDAO (Free2play challenges, Free2play Multiplayer Engine capabilities, Play2mint, ...)

More streams will be added in the future from new business opportunities.

There are two types of challenges: free2play and pay2play.

#### Free2play Challenges

Marketers and creators can reward their audience with product/brand/community-related digital assets for winning free2play challenges in their favourite games.

Users don't even need to have a Solana wallet to play these challenges.&#x20;

**The only way to do free2play challenges is by centralizing them. Because this is a centralized service given by gmiDAO, only gmiDAO members can create free2play challenges.**

#### Pay2play Challenges

Anyone, can easily create challenges for existing games.&#x20;

Because this is a decentralized service, users need to have a Solana wallet with enough Solana to pay and sign the entry fee.

creators can liquidity providers can lock digital assets in a challenge to earn the challengees’ entry fees.

They are betting that no player will win the challenge — prove them wrong!

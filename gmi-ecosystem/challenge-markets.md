There are two types of challenges: free2play and pay2play.

#### Free2play Challenges

Marketers and creators can reward their audiences with product/brand/community-related digital assets for winning free2play challenges in their favourite games.

Users only need to input their in-game userid to play these challenges (they don't even need to have a Solana wallet to play these challenges).

**The only way to do free2play challenges is by centralizing them. Because this is a centralized service provided by gmiDAO, only gmiDAO members can create free2play challenges for now.**

#### Pay2play Challenges

Anyone, can easily create challenges for existing games.&#x20;

Challenge designers lock digital assets in a challenge to earn the challengees’ entry fees. They are betting that no player will win the challenge — prove them wrong!

**Because this is a decentralized service, users need to have a Solana wallet with enough Solana to pay and sign the entry fee - even if the entry price is 0, maintaining the state of the match on-chain costs around $0.5 in SOL (most of it is recovered when the account is closed).**

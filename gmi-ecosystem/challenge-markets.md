# Challenge Markets

Anyone can create, invest and do challenges for existing games.

Liquidity providers can lock digital assets in a challenge to earn the challengees’ entry fees. Alternatively, marketers can reward participants with product/brand-related crypto assets.

They are betting that no player will win the challenge — prove them wrong!

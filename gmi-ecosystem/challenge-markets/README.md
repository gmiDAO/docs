There are two types of challenges: free2play and pay2play.

### Free2play Challenges

Users only need to input their in-game userid to play these challenges (they don't even need to have a Solana wallet to play these challenges).

**In** [**Solana**](https://solana.com) **(and any other blockchain), the only way to do completely free2play challenges is by centralizing them. Because this is a centralized service provided by gmiDAO, only gmiDAO members can create free2play challenges for now.**

### Pay2play Challenges

Users only need to input their in-game userid and have a Solana wallet with some SOL to pay the network fee to play these challenges.

**Because this is a decentralized service, users need to have a Solana wallet with enough Solana to pay and sign the entry fee - even if the entry price is 0, maintaining the state of the match on-chain costs around $0.5 in SOL (most of it is recovered when the match finishes).**

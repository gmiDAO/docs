There are two types of challenges: free2play and pay2play.

### Free2play Challenges

Users only need to input their in-game user ID to play these challenges (they don't even need to have a Solana wallet to play these challenges).

**In** [**Solana**](https://solana.com) **(and any other blockchain), the only way to do completely free2play challenges is by centralizing them. Because this is a brand new centralized service provided by gmiDAO, only selected members can create free2play challenges for now - if you want to create challenges,** [**join our discord**](https://discord.gg/rAnhpNqQmq) **and tell us!**

### Pay2play Challenges

Users need to input their in-game user id and have a Solana wallet with some SOL to pay the network fee to play these challenges.

**Because this is a decentralized service, users need to have a Solana wallet with enough Solana to pay and sign the entry fee - even if the entry price is 0, maintaining the state of the match on-chain costs around $0.2 in SOL (most of it is recovered when the match finishes).**

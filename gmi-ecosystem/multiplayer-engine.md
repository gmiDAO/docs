# üéè Multiplayer Engine

Easily play, create and invest in matches and tournaments for popular games.

Anyone can bid anything s/he/they want to challenge anyone to play a match/tournament in existing games. Solana smart contracts triggered by the results of the game will distribute the digital assets accordingly among participants. This can be used for Marketing and/or Betting purposes.

e.g. Anyone can challenge anyone anonymously. Only if the challengee accepts to play, people will know who the challenger is.

e.g. MonkeDAO bets "$500 GMI/player + worst-performing DAO player's NFT" that they beat ThugDAO at Counter-Strike.

# ðŸ•¹ Play2Mint

A new way to mint that favours the average Joe. Anyone can use this tool to drop their NFTs avoiding frontrunning and server overload. Further, the Play2Mint will be no-rug only, so people can mint comfortably. To have the right to mint NFTs, collectors will have to play a game and achieve the minimum required.

**In** [**Solana**](https://solana.com) **(and any other blockchain), the only way to do completely free2play challenges is by centralizing them. Because this is a brand new centralized service provided by gmiDAO, only selected members can use the Play2Mint capability for now - if you want to use the Play2Mint,** [**join our discord**](https://discord.gg/rAnhpNqQmq) **and tell us about you and your project!**

### Handy Game Phase 1 coming soon

Paper Hand NFTs can be minted at a discount if Clash Royale challenges are accomplished.

# Play2Mint

A new way to mint that favours the average Joe. Anyone can use this tool to drop their NFTs avoiding frontrunning and server overload. Further, GMI will be no-rug only, so people can mint comfortably. To have the right to mint NFTs, collectors will have to play a game and achieve the minimum required.

#### Handy Game Phase 1 coming soon

Hand NFTs can be minted as a discount if Clash Royale challenges are accomplished.

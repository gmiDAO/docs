# Why, how, who and what

### Why _Gonna Make It_?

A new web paradigm is being built, its name is Web 3.0 and has the potential to create a more inclusive economy by sharing ownership and upside among platform participants.

Even though Web 3.0 offers a new design space for consumer applications, the change must start from current user demand and habits. As Clayton Christensen says in _The Innovator's Dilemma_:

> "A technology has the potential to be _disruptive_ if the trajectory of improvement is steep enough to intersect the demand of the mainstream market."

_Gonna Make It_'s mission is to enable the transition from web 2.0 gaming to web 3.0 gaming at scale through [gonnamakeit.io](https://gonnamakeit.io).

### How _Gonna Make It_?

Currently, more than 3.2 billion people play games more than 7 hours per week on average and it is estimated that 40% of these people would like to compete for prizes. These data yield a \~1.32B people casual competitive gamers to be served. However, current competitive and social gaming platforms deliver a poor product with significant counterparty risk.

Using existing games' real-time results as oracles to trigger smart contracts in Solana, allows for a better competitive and social gaming experience by:

* **Ensuring by code** that prizes and staked assets will get **instantly** distributed according to the results of the game **at** a **low cost**.
* Allowing users to retain their funds.

Attracting people's attention has become harder than ever but gaming is one of the biggest attention keepers on earth.

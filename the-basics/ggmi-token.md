# GGMI token

$GGMI governance token for the GMI Universe. GGMI holders will be able to claim rewards if they stake their tokens, play the game, and participate in key governance votes. Players will also be able to earn $GGMI when they play various games within the GMI Universe and through user-generated content initiatives.

$GGMI is [gonnamakeit.app](http://gonnamakeit.app)'s governance token - this token will serve to vote on:

* New marketing campaign deals
* GMI influencer program
* New game integrations (e.g. future game integrations – if there is a group super good at LOL, they will want this game to be integrated ASAP to be able to challenge other teams in playing this game)
* New game modes (customized SCs allow for game modes)
* New official tournaments
* NFT pricing mechanisms to match the fair value of bets
* …

Our goal with $GGMI is to align the incentives between the players of the GMI experiences and the developers in novel and exciting ways. The mechanisms described above have two main goals:&#x20;

* To reward players for interacting with GMI while simultaneously incentivizing them to hold on to their tokens so they can claim additional rewards.
* To decentralize the ownership and governance of GMI.

We want GMI to become the first truly community-owned brand and operated by the community that plays it. This opens up limitless possibilities but must be approached carefully. The shift to a true Decentralized organization will occur gradually over time.&#x20;
